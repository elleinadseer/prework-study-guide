## Usage

During our pre-work study students have learnt about HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git; we have taken notes on these topics. We have created functions displaying the topics we have learnt and a randomised recommendation as to what topic we should learn first. These functions can be seen at work via the DevTools console.
